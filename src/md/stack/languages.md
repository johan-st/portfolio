# languages

In my most recent projects I have almost exclusively used **typescript** over **javascript**.

- **TypeScript**
- **JavaScript**
- [**elm**](https://elm-lang.org)
- **go**
- **php**

---

_some experience with..._

- **C#** (& **.net**)
- **python**
- **java**

## sidenote

I have started looking into **haskell** as a means to experiment with a fully functional stack in conjuction with **elm**. I belive this could be an intresting combination although **go** is my prefered serverside language at the moment
