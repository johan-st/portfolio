# languages

In my most recent projects I have almost exclusively used __typescript__ over __javascript__.

  - __TypeScript__
  - __JavaScript__
  - [__elm__](https://elm-lang.org)
 ______________
 *some experience with...*
  - __C#__ (& __.net__)
  - __python__
  - __java__
  - __php__
  - __go__

## sidenote
I have started looking into __haskell__ as a means to experiment with a fully functional stack in conjuction with __elm__.
