# Back-End

I enjoy the more technical nature of backend work and strive for **robust** and **testable** solutions. Since my graduation from <\/salt> I have been learning **go** and have been experimenting with api's, web-servers and cli-tools.      

- **Go**
- **Node**
- **Express**
- **REST API**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MongoDB**
- **GraphQL**
