# Who am I?

My life as a developer started in ernest in December 2020 when I graduated from School of applied technology [</salt>](https://salt.dev/) with 30 fellow students. We were selected among 1500 candidates for a three months accelerated career program to become a **Full-Stack JavaScript developer**. I was engaged as a consultant after my first interview and has since worked full time as a fullstack web developer.  

My maxim is _"strive for continious and sustainable improvement"_. I am a **problem solver** by nature and work hard to find pragmatic solutions within the given constraints. 

On this page you will find my _"tech-stack"_, some of my [projects](/projects) and the specific stack for each project. [This portfolio](/projects/portfolio) for instance.
