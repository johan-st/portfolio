# Who Am I?

In December I graduated from School of applied technology [</salt>](https://salt.dev/) with 30 fellow students. We were selected among 1500 candidates for a three months accelerated career program to become a **Full-Stack JavaScript developer**.

My maxim is _"strive for continious and sustainable improvement"_. I am a **problem solver** by nature and work hard to find pragmatic solutions within the given constraints.

Now it's time to get started working as a developer! If you are interested in hiring me, take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-strand-99a12b44/) or write me an [email](mailto:johan.strand@appliedtechnology.se).

On this page you will find my tech-stack, my [projects](/projects) and the specific stack for each project. [This portfolio's stack for instance](/projects/portfolio)
