# heroku

This app is deployed as a container through heroku. As a developer it is as easy as running three commands:
    
- __npm run build__    

- __heroku container:push web -a johan-st__

- __heroku container:release web -a johan-st__

In this case I have chosen to priotitize speed and easy of use over other considerations such as enforced tests.
