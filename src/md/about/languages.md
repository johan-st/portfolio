In my most recent projects I have almost exclusively used __typescript__ over __javascript__.


Ever since I learned **elm** ([link](https://elm-lang.org)) I have become used to _type-checking_ and the promise of _"no runtime exceptions"_. **typescript** does not make the same promises but it does provide exellent and flexible type-safety.
