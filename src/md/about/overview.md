# Who Am I?

In December 2020, I graduated from School of applied technology [**<â€‹/salt>**](https://salt.dev/) with 30 fellow students. We were selected among 1500 candidates for a three months accelerated career program to become a **Full-Stack JavaScript developer**.

Now, as a Full Stack developer, I have found a place where my love for tech and need for creativity can both live under the same roof. My maxim is _"strive for continual and sustainable improvement"_. I am a **problem solver** by nature and work hard to find pragmatic solutions by leveraging the entire team's knowledge and experience.

While the technology I am most familiar with today is the **MERN**-stack _(**M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **R**eact, **N**odeJS)_ I do have experience with several other languages and tools. _(see below)_

I have always had an interest in technology and computer science and have mainly worked in the broad IT-field _(and for a while as a photographer)_.
