# typescript
In my most recent projects I have almost exclusively used __typescript__ over __javascript__.

Since I learned **elm** ([a functional language for web-apps](https://elm-lang.org)) I have become used to _type-checking_ and the promise of _"no runtime exceptions"_. **typescript** does not make the same promises but it does provide type-safety. This is a big plus, especially when a codebase grows large.
