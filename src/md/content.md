# Content Management 
This page has no need of advanced content management but is generated from content in json and markdown format. I've found this to be a fast and simple way to manage content.

The changes needed to have the content be fetched through an external api is minimal. Good practice and in my opinion, easy to use.

To illustrate, here is an _example json-object._

\`\`\`bash
{
  title: "content",
  markdown: "# Content... ",
  path: '/content'
}
\`\`\`
