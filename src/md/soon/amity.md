## 2 week project

Me and my colleauge and friend [Viktor](https://github.com/ViktorNorman) created Amity as a two week exploration of webRTC and related technologies. We did this as our final project during our training at \</salt>.

There is currently no live version of this but feel free to check out our [gitHub repo](https://github.com/superlistic/amity).

Amity is a way of staying social in these isolated times. With Amity we want to make remote work more fun, exciting and socially rewarding. By utilizing WebRTC and sockets the users connect each other randomly through our matchmaking. Thereafter the two connected users have quick real time communication with both video and chat.


### Features of our two week MVP are:
- Matchmaking between users
- Text and video chat between users
- Authorized login with user accounts 
- Chat suggestions of conversation topics
