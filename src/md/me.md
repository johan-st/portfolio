# Who am I you ask?
As a Full Stack Engineer I've found a place where my love for tech and need for creativity can both live under the same roof. My maxim is to always develop my skills and I love trying new things. 

Although the tech I'm most familiar with is is __React__, __Elm__, __HTML__, __CSS__ and of course __JavaScript/Typescript__ on the frontend and __Express.js__, __MongoDB__, __Docker__ and __AWS__ on the backend I have been dipping my toes in a few other ponds and I am confident in my ability to quickly get up to speed on most common technologies.`,
