# CSS3 & BEM

As of the introduction of __custom properties__ in __CSS3__ I've found that I generaly don't benefit from CSS pre-processors.
I have come to much the same conclusion as _Jose Carlos Ixcoat_l in his article ["Still using CSS preprocessors in 2020?"](https://medium.com/@bartsis/still-using-css-preprocessors-in-2020-aa893a476bc4).

In short; the **BEM** model in conjunction __custom properties__ provides enough specificity and flexibility for me not to miss **SASS**, making the extra tooling unnecessary.
