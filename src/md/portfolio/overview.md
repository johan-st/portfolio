# What about this site?

I have build most of this site from scratch with relatively _few dependencies_. In short this site is built almost exclusively in __React__. 

Initially it was served by a __node-express__ server and packed into an easily distributable __container__. 

Now I host it as a static site on **Digital Ocean**. It is automatically built and deployed when chages are pushed to the git repository (*Continuous Delivery*).
