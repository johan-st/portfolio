# React
This app is built using react. As one of the frameworks I am most familiar with this was an easy choice for a single developer project.

However I always strive to write reusable code and expect parts of this portfolio can be repurposed in future projects the same way some code in this project is based on a previous todo-app I've been developing for personal use.
